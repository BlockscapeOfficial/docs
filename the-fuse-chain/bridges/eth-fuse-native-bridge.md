# Blockscape: Ethereum â†” Blockscape

Blockscape native bridge between Ethereum and Blockscape is used to relay the Blockscape native token from Blockscape to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Blockscape bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Blockscape tokens between the Blockscape chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Blockscape or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Blockscape tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Blockscape chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Blockscape chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Blockscape chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Blockscape chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

## How to use

On Blockscape you send native Blockscape token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Blockscape token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Blockscape token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Blockscape native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
