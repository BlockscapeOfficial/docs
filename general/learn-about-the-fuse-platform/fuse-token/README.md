# Blockscape Token (BLC)

The BLC token is the native currency of the Blockscape blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BLC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Blockscape blockchain, BLC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Blockscape to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 1500K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.blockscape.net/](https://status.blockscape.net/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BLC. Which means validators with higher amounts of Blockscape staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BLC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BLC they wish. They receive a share of the Blockscape block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BLC is the native currency on Blockscape, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BLC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BLC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Blockscape platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
